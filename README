  -- Welcome to midcutils, a simple C utility library -- 


--[ Overview ]-----------------------------------------------

midcutils was developed in order to get me back into C programming
and capture some of the basic core utilities that most C programmers
build for themselves or get from other helper libraries.

At present, there is nothing here that is novel or you can't get from
somewhere else.  Overtime, I hope to continue adding to the utility
library.



--[ Functionality ]---------------------------------------------

midcutils has three areas of functionality:

* generic helper functions, such as atoi, strdup, strrev, stricmp
  ** see midcutils.h for a full list and documentation

* a generic resizable array-based stack that can take any data type,
  since it is a stack of void *.  It implements the standard functions
  of a stack ADT.
  ** see midcstack.h for a full list and documentation

* a generic resizable array-based queue that can take any data type,
  since it is a queue of void *.  It implements the standard functions
  of a queue ADT.
  ** see midcstack.h for a full list and documentation


--[ Dependencies ]---------------------------------------------

midcutil is written in ANSI C 99.

Besides ANSI C headers, the only dependency is on midcunit, my
unit testing framework, for running the unit tests.

midcunit can be obtained here: https://github.com/midpeter444/midcunit



--[ Creation and Installation ]----------------------------------------

Both static and shared libraries for midcutils can be created. The
creation and installation of the shared libraries depends on libtool.

See the documentation in the Makefile and libtool.mk makefiles.

To build, test and install shared and static libraries using libtool, do
make -f libtool.mk 
make -f libtool.mk test
make -f libtool.mk install


--[ Tests ]----------------------------------------

There are full unit tests for all midutils functions in the test dir.

To run the tests you must have midcunit installed:
https://github.com/midpeter444/midcunit

You can run the test from any Makefile, including the one in the 
test directory.
